# Quadratic equation solver

Consol app which created as task for KPI.

## How to Build and Run
Clone the repository 

```
git clone <https://github.com/Kiryaoo/Quadratic-equation-solver.git>
cd <Quadrativ equation solver>
``` 
After instalation app can runs without any argument in interactive mode with this command

```
python Solver.py
```
### Example

```
$ python Solver.py
a = 2
b = 3
c = 4
Equation is: (2.0) x^2 + (3.0) x + (4.0) = 0
There are 0 roots
```

To run in file mode you must specify the path to the file 

```
python Solver.py equation.py
```
### File format 
```
1 0 0
```

### Example
```
$ python Solver.py D:\equation.txt
Equation is: (1.0) x^2 + (0.0) x + (0.0) = 0
There are 1 roots
x1 = -0.0
```
